	The Software is not intended to be used as a medical device or for
	purposes of medical analysis, diagnosis or treatment. To the
	maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the Software is
	provided “as is”, with all faults, and without any warranty,
	express or implied and we hereby disclaim all warranties of title,
	non-infringement, merchantability, fitness for a particular

	To the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law, you agree to
	indemnify and hold harmless CZ Biohub, its affiliates, and its and
	their successors, assigns, officers, directors, employees, and
	agents (including CZ Biohub, the “CZ Biohub Protected Parties” and
	each, a “CZ Biohub Protected Party”) from and against any and all
	liabilities, costs, damages, charges, losses, penalties,
	judgments, settlements, and expenses (including reasonable
	attorney’s fees) arising out of or related to any suit, demand,

	This Agreement and all matters arising out of or relating to it,
	whether sounding in contract, tort, or statute shall be governed
	by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of

	You will comply with all applicable export controls of the United
	States, the European Union, and any other applicable governmental
	authority, including the U.S. Export Administration Regulations
	and U.S. International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”). You

13. Severability.

	If any part of this Agreement is held to be invalid or
	unenforceable, then such part will be construed, as nearly as
	possible, to reflect the intentions of the invalid or
	unenforceable part, with all other portions of this Agreement
	remaining in full force and effect.

14. Assignment.

	We may freely assign our rights or delegate our obligations under
	this Agreement. In the event of an assignment, the Agreement will
	remain in full force and effect and will bind the permitted
	assignee.

	This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and us
	regarding the Software. If you wish to modify the Agreement, any
	amendment must be provided to us in writing and signed by our
	authorized representative.  No waiver of any of the provisions of
	this Agreement will constitute a waiver of any other provision
	(whether or not similar). No waiver will be binding unless
	executed in writing by the party to be bound by the waiver.

16. Construction.

	The words “including” shall be deemed to be followed by “without
	limitation”. Unless context expressly requires otherwise, the
	conjunction “or” shall be understood in its inclusive sense
	(and/or).

17. Equitable relief.

	A breach of these terms may give rise to irreparable harm for
	which monetary damages would not be adequate; in the event of such
	a breach or threatened breach, a party may seek equitable relief
	in addition to other rights and remedies that may be available.
